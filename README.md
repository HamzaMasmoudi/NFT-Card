## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This one is very similar to the QRCode Card but it took me longer because of the hover effect on the main image but I still got it in the end
I really felt relieve and I was proud when i was able to complete the hover effect which really made my day.
